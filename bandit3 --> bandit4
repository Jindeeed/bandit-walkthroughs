## Goal
Enter file and grab the password

## Comands needed

ls -- list all files inside (just to check)
cd -- change to the directory
find -- powerful tool to find everything (probably not needed here as we only need to search the directory we are in)

## Potential drawbacks

This is a directory so we cant just cat to a file indtead we need to cd (change directory) and enter the directory
It is also a hidden file so we must use a special method


We are going to first ls to look for the directories

then cd to this directory

now ls to find any files 
Clearly we see we cannot see any files as they are hidden 

So we should look for hidden files (they begin with a .)

command we use is -- ls -d .*

usage of -d is not really necessary here but in an alternate setting it would print the directory as well as the files. 
but the directory would be printed without its contents

once we see the file

we can cat to it
but we must use ./ as the file has special characters

also be sure to use "" to tell the system it is all apart of one string
