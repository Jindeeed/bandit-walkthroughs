# Goal of level

The goal of this level is to connect to the game using SSH. SSH stands for secure shell 
which is an encrypted network protocol which allows two devices to communicate and share data securely
We must login to the game using the web address  "bandit.labs.overthewire.org" on port 2220. We must remember the username bandit0 as this is used in the initial command.
The password is also bandit0 for ease of access.
REMEMBER - this is the only information given and for a reason.
