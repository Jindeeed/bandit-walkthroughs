# Goal of level

The goal of this level is to connect to the game using SSH. SSH stands for secure shell 
which is an encrypted network protocol which allows two devices to communicate and share data securely
We must login to the game using the web address  "bandit.labs.overthewire.org" on port 2220. We must remember the username bandit0 as this is used in the initial command.
The password is also bandit0 for ease of access.
REMEMBER - this is the only information given and for a reason.



# My thinking

Firstly it becomes obvious as this is only level 0 we must simply use a command to connect. As they specified its an SSH connection we must use an SSH command.
A password will prop and we must enter it --> we were given this in the original challenge.
I realise that we will need the '-p' command to conect to the port given to us, port 2220.

# commands i used

I used the SSH command and the '-p' command to specify the port number i would like to establish the connection on.
