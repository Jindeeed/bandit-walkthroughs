# Goal of Level
  We want to enter the file - and find the password

# Potential setbacks

  Since in linux "-" is a special symbol. We cannot simpply cat our way into it but we must use the directory command ./ to specify it is the file we want to enter
  - is the standard option character. We used it in the last level to specify the port "-p"



Login to bandit1 using ssh at port 2220 (this would use a special command we explored in our last level  -- ssh bandit1@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220


now the password should be found in the previous levels file -- Please store this in a text file created on your linux machine

Once inside the ssh connection lets list all the files to make sure we have a "-" file. Use the ls command

Now we can cat and specify the directory --   cat ./-

we should now have the password
