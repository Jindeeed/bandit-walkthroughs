# Potention setbacks 

  The file name has spaces in between each word, therefore if we cat to it normally we are basically asking the system to look for four files -
    These files are: "spaces", "in", "this" and "filename" 

Therefore to tell the system that it is part of one file we must use quotation marks

HOWEVER!!!!!

We also cannot just cat to the file, because we have dashes "--" at the bginning and end#


Therefore we are going to use the same command "./"
